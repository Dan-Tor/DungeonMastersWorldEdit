Dungeon Master's World Edit (DMWE) is intended to help fellow DM's managed games of D&D (or any game they please)
The idea behind it is to keep track of NPC's and generate random events for the players playing.
Nowhere near finished but some tasks I have in mind to implement are:

    - Creating NPC's
    - Editing NPC's
    - Deleting NPC's
    - Implementing a Vector List to hold NPC's
    - Displaying NPC's
    - Randomly Generate NPC's
    - Being able to read NPC's from a .txt and also save existing NPC's to a .txt
    - GUI to facilitate users
    - A simple economic model to simulate in-game economy for players
    - A simple generator of events, from quests to just random events.
    - A random loot generator for players
