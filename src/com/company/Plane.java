    Rough idea:
    Plane: Innistrad
    Status: More reported sightings of werewolf packs have led to the following results:
    Locals are more distrusting of visitors. Overcharging players 10% more items.
    Quest Hook: Find the werewolf pack and get rid of them
    NPC: X NPC has been killed off by [creature]


    Plane: Bant
    Status: Hostilties amongst the neighboring kingdoms have ceased.
    Resulting in a return to normalcy and a surplus of goods being sold at a discount.
    Quest Hook: Escort the merchants wares from one town to the next.
    NPC: X NPC has succeded in the trials and gain a promotion.
